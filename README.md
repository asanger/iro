# Iro (è‰²)

Tired of OSX color picker apps either totally sucking or costing money. This one is open source and _hopefully_ doesn't suck.

## Developer Color Picker

[Panic - Developer Color Picker](https://panic.com/~wade/picker/)

This color picker is probably what you want to use with Iro. It will provide you with several color formats with the ability to copy to clipboard.

__Installing Panic's Developer Color Picker__

```bash
$ mv DeveloperColorPicker.colorPicker ~/Library/ColorPickers/DeveloperColorPicker.colorPicker
```
